You will need to go into source and open the [index.html](source/index.html) file.

It uses your webcam as input so you will need to allow it to access your camera, it's part of the virus, so I can spy on you.

And if you do this, it will show you a live feed of your camera in ascii art.

Have fun with it

P.S. Ik the addons folder only contains sound related stuff, but I'm honestly too scared to delete them.
